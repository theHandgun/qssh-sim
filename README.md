# Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Simulator
As part of the QSSH protocol, which allows provably-secure shell access to a remote computer, this program can be used to simulate the [BB84 QKD protocol](https://www.google.com](https://medium.com/quantum-untangled/quantum-key-distribution-and-bb84-protocol-6f03cc6263c5) used between quantum computers.
To deal with the qubit limits imposed by quantum computers, this simulator allows for multiple repetitions of the BB84 protocol, limit is set on the config file, to use less qubits.
